Index card found years later, signed by the three kids, dated July, 2003

1. Fork reaches velocities too fast to be seen by the human eye.
2. At least one exclamation of delight in (the short time) between every bite.
3. Multiple trips for kleenex and more cranberry juice.
4. Dad seen avoiding dinner at all costs.
5. While dad procures yogurt and cereal, the uneaten food on his plate spontaneously ignites.

Alternate #5 suggested by Blue Eyes: "While dad is getting other food, the uneaten food at his plate disappears, leaving only a trail of smoke leading directly to mom's plate"

## "Yum! This is right good!"

The above ending to the index card was our way of teasing mom's momism. What she really said was, "I didn't know you could cook like *that!*"
