Mom was born in 1951 near Miami, Florida. She passed away in Laramie, Wyoming in August, 2024 while tentatively moving to California to be closer to her grandchildren. 

She graduated from Duke University, remained in Durham to work in medical research, then in 1981 moved to Evanston, Illinois where she lived the rest of her life and raised her children. During that time she wrote the newsletter for her kids’ school and worked in the Registrar’s Office at Kendall College, later obtaining a master’s degree in linguistics from Northeastern Illinois University. 

She is survived by her children, two grandchildren, brother, sister, nephew, niece, and ex-husband. 

Mom was an avid reader and researcher, loved walking along the lake, happily chatted with people everywhere she went, and volunteered for [FreeGeek](https://www.freegeek.org/) Chicago, learning to rebuild computers to prevent waste. She also had a love for gardening, photography, trains, cats, birdwatching, and hot sauce. She died peacefully, surrounded by family, after a battle with cancer.

In memory of her, please feel free to make a donation to the [Native American Rights Fund](https://narf.org/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, the [American Indian College Fund](https://collegefund.org/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, or [Freegeek](https://www.freegeek.org/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. If there is a Freegeek near you who sells computers rebuilt by volunteers, then please do support it.
