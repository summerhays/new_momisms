By Jove ([momism ID #47](/dictionary/047)),  a [searchable](/search) list of [all {{ site.data.mom-csv.size }}](/list) of mother's momisms â€” the whole shebangdasium ([#143](/dictionary/143)), compiled by her children (a.k.a. brown boy ([#306](/dictionary/306)), blue-eyes ([#14](/dictionary/014)), and baby doll ([#135](/dictionary/135))), since 2009, thanks to our good ears for language and our great fingers for typing ([#192](/dictionary/192)). Noting our mother's love for "of the day" websites such as NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, we designed this website to highlight one momism per day (MOD).

But wait, isn't a momism [_an undue dependence on maternal protection, resulting in loss of independence_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/momism){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}? Certainly not! 

Suffice it to say ([#34](/dictionary/034)), in these parts ([#114](/dictionary/114)), we know the true definition. A momism is a word that only our mother says; or barring that, when we hear this word, our mother pops immediately to mind.

Our faces upon hearing a new momism: ![confused smiley]({{ site.icon }}){: height="25px" width="25px" class="w3-spin"}
