By Jove ([momism ID #42](/dictionary/042)),  a [searchable](/search) list of [all {{ site.data.mom-csv.size }}](/list) of mother's momisms â€” the whole shebangdasium ([#130](/dictionary/130)), compiled by her children (a.k.a. brown boy ([#282](/dictionary/282)), blue-eyes ([#12](/dictionary/012)), and baby doll ([#123](/dictionary/123))), since 2009, thanks to our good ears for language and our great fingers for typing ([#175](/dictionary/175)). Noting our mother's love for "of the day" websites such as NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, we designed this website to highlight a momism of the day (MOD).

But wait, isn't a momism [_an undue dependence on maternal protection, resulting in loss of independence_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/momism){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}? Certainly not! 

Suffice it to say ([#31](/dictionary/031)), in these parts ([#105](/dictionary/105)), we know the true definition. A momism is a word that only our mother says; or barring that, when we hear this word, our mother pops immediately to mind.

Our faces upon hearing a new momism: ![confused smiley]({{ site.icon }}){: height="25px" width="25px" class="w3-spin"}
