Here's our list of momisms that don't quite make the cut:

* *According to conventional wisdom*. Not sure anyone else talks like that but not sure it's a momism either.
* *Coot*. Definition:  Someone confused, often because of age, as in "The ability to understand the smart phone is evading this old coot." Other people do say this, but we'd never heard it before mom did. 
* *Gripe*. Mother does say this a **lot** but we suppose that doesn't automatically a momism make.
* *Hare-brained*
* *"Is that goat cheese? Ewe!"* This eye-rolling pun may be typical of our mother, but it's not a momism.
* *Mind your Ps and Qs*. Mom does say this a lot, but other people do occasionnally.
* *Oh brother*. Ditto. Mom says it a lot but others do occasionally.
* *Speak of the devil*. Seems to fit mother's melodrama well but other people do say this.
* *No spring chicken*. Mother does say this a **lot** but we suppose that doesn't automatically a momism make.
* *Three eggs in a basket is finer 'en fourteen in the chicken coop*. Apocryphal momism, used to tease mother’s strange sayings.
* *Take a long walk off a short dock*.
* *Up the wazoo*. Seems to fit mother's melodrama well but other people do say this.
* *Went the way of the dodo*

## Kidisms
Mom is one of the few people we know who keeps saying kidisms from when we were 2, nearly 40 years later. We suppose they are momisms but they belong on a separate list.

* *Ka-broken*. Admittedly awesome kidism from blue eyes, means broken.
* *Splinker*. Admittedly awesome kidism from blue eyes, means a splinter.
* *Airdishconer*. Blue eyes for air conditioner.
* *Fewidgewator*. Blue eyes for refridgerator.
* *Meemer*. Vacuum cleaner.
* *Woo-wee-sa*. Kidism for Louisa. Mom started imitating her, saying "eww-wee-sa" but Baby Doll crossly corrected mother to "woo-wee-sa." 
  * This same daughter also used to spell Emily’s name "MOE."
* *Wooze*. To lose.
