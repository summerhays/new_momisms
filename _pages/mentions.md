<h2 class="title"><i class="fa-solid fa-award"></i> &nbsp;Honorable Mentions/<a href="/dictionary/040">Honourable Horrors (#40)</a></h2>
  
Here's our list of momisms that don't quite make the cut:

* *At the drop of a hat*. Definition: without delay or good reason.
* *Bouncing off the walls*. Hyperactive. The behavior of young children at a high-sugar birthday party.
* *Cheese thingy*. Homemade quesadilla.
* *Coming down with something*. Contracting an illness.
* *Coot*. Someone confused, often because of age, as in "The ability to understand the smart phone is evading this old coot." Other people do say this, but we'd never heard it before mom did. 
* *Disaster waiting to happen*. A risky plan or situation.
* *Gripe*. Mother does say this a **lot** but we suppose that doesn't automatically a momism make.
* *Hare-brained*. Dimwitted.
* *Harrumph!*. (Exclamation).
* *Indeed*. Mother does end many a-sentence using this word, *indeed*. But this is an hono(u)rable mention/horror more than it is a momism.
* *"Is that goat cheese? Ewe!"* This eye-rolling pun may be typical of our mother, but it's not a momism.
* *Mind your Ps and Qs*. Mom does say this a lot, but other people do occasionnally.
* *No spring chicken*. Mother does say this a **lot** but we suppose that doesn't automatically a momism make.
* *Off I went*. Ditto. Mom says it a lot but others do occasionally.
* *Oh brother*. Ditto.
* *Other people don't say that?*. Mom says this so often in response to our momist documentation that it's an honourable mention.
* *Reasonably well*. How mom claims she is doing 99% of the time. But I suppose we have heard other people say it.
* *Somewhere along the line*. Definition: At some point. Do other people say this? We don't even know anymore, but figured we'd add it here while opinions roll in.
* *Speak of the devil*. Seems to fit mother's melodrama well but other people do say this.
* *Take a long walk off a short dock*
* *Three eggs in a basket is finer 'en fourteen in the chicken coop*. Apocryphal momism, used to tease mother’s strange sayings.
* *Up the wazoo*. Seems to fit mother's melodrama well but other people do say this.
* *Went the way of the dodo*. Even restaurants can go the way of the dodo, apparently.
* *What am I forgetting^*. What mom says whenever leaving the house.

### Kidisms
Mom is one of the few people we know who keeps saying kidisms from when we were 2, nearly 40 years later. We suppose they are momisms but they belong on a separate list.

* *Airdishconer*. Blue-eyes for air conditioner.
* *Fewidgewator*. Blue-eyes for refridgerator.
* *Ka-broken*. Admittedly awesome kidism from blue-eyes, means broken.
* *Meemer*. Blue-eyes for vacuum cleaner.
* *Perpers/Lippers*. Similarly, Blue-eyes for slippers. Perpers was "crossly" ([#62](/dictionary/062/)) corrected to "lippers."
* *Splinker*. Admittedly awesome kidism from blue-eyes, means a splinter.
* *Woo-wee-sa*. Kidism for Louisa. Mom started imitating the Killer Baby, saying "eww-wee-sa" but was "crossly" ([#64](/dictionary/062/)) corrected to "woo-wee-sa." 
  * This same daughter also used to spell Emily’s name "MOE," one of mother's preferred tales.
* *Wooze*. To lose.
